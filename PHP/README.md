The following directory contains a list of various plugins that I have authored for wordpress based sites.

**edit-profile**

- a plugin that interacts with WooCommerce as well as an external API to display, save, and update a users personal information.
Some of the fields may not be edited by a user like a users profile ID and other fields are using a dropdown menu for user selection such as Country
- when a user saves their profile using 1 of 2 submit buttons an external api call is made which updates a MongoDB document store with the users newly saved information and afterwards the user_meta table on WooCommerce is also updated 


**nav-bar** 

- a plugin to dynamically create a navigation bar for desktop as well as a hamburger menu for mobile devices
